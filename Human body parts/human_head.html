<p><center><b>Human head Description:</center></b><p><br><br>
The human head consists of a fleshy outer portion, which surrounds the bony skull. The brain is enclosed within the skull. There are 22 bones in the human head. The head rests on the neck, and the seven cervical vertebrae support it. The human head typically weighs between 2.3 and 5 kilograms<br>

The face is the anterior part of the head, containing the eyes, nose, and mouth.<br> On either side of the mouth, the cheeks provide a fleshy border to the oral cavity. The ears sit to either side of the head.<br>

<b>Blood supply:</b><br>
The head receives blood supply through the internal and external carotid arteries. <br>These supply the area outside of the skull (external carotid artery) and inside of the skull (internal carotid artery). <br>The area inside the skull also receives blood supply from the vertebral arteries, which travel up through the cervical vertebrae.
