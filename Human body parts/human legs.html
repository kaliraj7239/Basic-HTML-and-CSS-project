<body bgcolor="Orange">
The human leg, in the general word sense, is the entire lower limb[1][2] of the human body, including the foot, thigh and even the hip or gluteal region. <br>However, the definition in human anatomy refers only to the section of the lower limb extending from the knee to the ankle, also known as the crus[3][4][5] or, especially in non-technical use, the shank.
