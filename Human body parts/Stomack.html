The stomach is a muscular organ located on the left side of the upper abdomen.<br> The stomach receives food from the esophagus.<br> As food reaches the end of the esophagus, it enters the stomach through a muscular valve called the lower esophageal sphincter.<br>

The stomach secretes acid and enzymes that digest food. <br>Ridges of muscle tissue called rugae line the stomach. The stomach muscles contract periodically, churning food to enhance digestion.<br> The pyloric sphincter is a muscular valve that opens to allow food to pass from the stomach to the small intestine.
